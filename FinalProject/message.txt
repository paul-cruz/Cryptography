Dear Bob



Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my live complete
And I love you so
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me tender
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of times
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darling I love you
And I always will
For my darling I love you
And I always will
